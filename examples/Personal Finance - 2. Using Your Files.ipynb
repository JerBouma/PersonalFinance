    "Tracking personal finances can be tedious. It either requires a massive time investment to keep everything well categorized as new transactions come in or it is far from accurate with tools that try to do prediction to define categories for you. Perhaps it works fine for names such as \"Wall Mart\" or \"Starbucks\" but your local bakery called \"Morty's Place\" is definitely not going to get picked up by the model. Many personal finance tools allow you to manually adjust these categories but that is just as tedious as doing it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through defining each category with appropriate keywords, you can be sure that the model will categorise transactions how you defined them. This is because it is not a generic model that is trained on a large dataset of transactions from all over the world. It is trained on your own data, which means that it will be able to categorise transactions that are specific to you. This results in Morty's Place being correctly categorised as a Bakery.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist in not needing to get **exact** matches, the package makes use of the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to determine how similar two strings are. This means that if you have a category called \"Groceries\" with the keyword \"Supermarket\" and a transaction comes in with the name \"Rick's Super Market\", it will still be categorised as \"Groceries\". There is a limited amount of Mumbo Jumbo going on here on purpose so that it still becomes logical why it is categorised as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing most of these things through Python and Excel, you have the complete freedom to decide what to do with the output. For example, you can use it to create your own personalized dashboards via any programming language or application such as Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, etc. **I don't want to bore you with custom dashboards that I tailored to myself just so that you can come to the conclusion that it isn't a perfect fit for you.**\n",
